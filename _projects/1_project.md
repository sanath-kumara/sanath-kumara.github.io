I designed this carton lifting mechanism during my internship at Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/cartonliftmechanism.JPG" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

</div>

This mechanism is used to capture carton from outfeed converor of the packaging maching and place it on the main conveyor.
