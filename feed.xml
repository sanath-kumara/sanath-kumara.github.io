It was created to improve the UNIX operating system and quickly became popular due to its simplicity and efficiency. On the other hand, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of C. Stroustrup aimed to add object-oriented features to C to create a more powerful and versatile language.</p> <p>One of the fundamental differences between C and C++ lies in their programming paradigms. C is a procedural programming language, focusing on functions and procedures to perform tasks. This approach emphasizes a linear flow of control and is well-suited for straightforward, procedural tasks.</p> <p>In contrast, C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. This dual capability allows developers to use objects and classes to create more complex and reusable code structures. The object-oriented paradigm promotes better organization, code reuse, and modularity, making C++ a preferred choice for large-scale software projects.</p> <p>C does not support object-oriented features such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. These concepts are central to object-oriented programming and are fully supported in C++. Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, encapsulation enables data hiding, and inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and flexibility.</p> <p>Memory management is another area where C and C++ differ significantly. In C, dynamic memory allocation is managed using functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">malloc()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">free()</code>. These functions provide basic memory allocation capabilities but require manual handling of memory deallocation, which can lead to errors and memory leaks.</p> <p>C++ introduces operators like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delete</code> for dynamic memory management. Additionally, C++ provides constructors and destructors for automatic initialization and cleanup of objects, simplifying memory management and reducing the likelihood of memory leaks.</p> <p>The standard libraries in C and C++ also differ in scope and functionality. C’s standard library is simpler and smaller, primarily focused on functions for input/output, string manipulation, and memory allocation. It provides the essential tools needed for basic programming tasks. C++, however, includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers a rich set of template classes and functions for data structures and algorithms. The STL provides powerful tools for managing collections of data, such as vectors, lists, and maps, and includes algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating these collections.</p> <p>C does not support function overloading or templates. Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, enabling more flexible and intuitive code. Templates allow for generic programming, where functions and classes can operate with any data type. C++ supports both function overloading and templates, providing greater flexibility and enabling the creation of highly reusable and generic code.</p> <p>Error handling in C is done through functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setjmp()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">longjmp()</code>, which provide a mechanism for non-local jumps in case of errors. However, this approach is relatively primitive and can be cumbersome to use. C++ offers a robust exception handling mechanism using the try, catch, and throw keywords. This mechanism allows for more structured and readable error handling, making it easier to write reliable and maintainable code.</p> <p>Namespaces are a feature in C++ that help avoid name collisions and organize code better. By encapsulating identifiers (such as variables, functions, and classes) within a namespace, developers can prevent conflicts and maintain cleaner code. C does not support namespaces, which can lead to potential naming conflicts in large projects.</p> <p>C code can generally be compiled in a C++ compiler, making it relatively easy to integrate C code into C++ projects. However, not all C++ features are compatible with C. C++ is considered a superset of C, meaning it includes all of C’s features along with additional ones.</p> <p>Above discussed differences can be shown in as follows.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Feature</th> <th style="text-align: left">C</th> <th style="text-align: left">C++</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Origin and Development</td> <td style="text-align: left">Developed by Dennis Ritchie (1969-1973) at AT&amp;T Bell Labs</td> <td style="text-align: left">Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of C</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Programming Paradigm</td> <td style="text-align: left">Procedural programming</td> <td style="text-align: left">Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Object-Oriented Features</td> <td style="text-align: left">Does not support object-oriented features like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance</td> <td style="text-align: left">Supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Memory Management</td> <td style="text-align: left">Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">malloc()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">free()</code> for dynamic memory allocation</td> <td style="text-align: left">Introduces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delete</code> operators, along with constructors and destructors</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Standard Libraries</td> <td style="text-align: left">Simpler and smaller standard library, focused on I/O, string manipulation, and memory allocation</td> <td style="text-align: left">Includes the Standard Template Library (STL) with template classes and functions for data structures and algorithms</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Function Overloading and Templates</td> <td style="text-align: left">Does not support function overloading or templates</td> <td style="text-align: left">Supports function overloading and templates for generic programming</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Exception Handling</td> <td style="text-align: left">Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setjmp()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">longjmp()</code> for error handling</td> <td style="text-align: left">Provides robust exception handling using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throw</code> keywords</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Namespaces</td> <td style="text-align: left">Does not support namespaces</td> <td style="text-align: left">Uses namespaces to avoid name collisions and organize code better</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Compatibility</td> <td style="text-align: left">C code can generally be compiled in a C++ compiler</td> <td style="text-align: left">Considered a superset of C, includes all of C’s features along with additional ones</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>While C and C++ share many similarities, they differ significantly in their capabilities and programming paradigms.
